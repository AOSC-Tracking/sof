##ALSA Plugin

The SOF ALSA plugin allows SOF topologies to be run on the host. The plugin
is still WIP with many rough edges that need refined before production
deployment, however the plugin is usable today as a rapid development
framework for SOF infrastructure and processing.

#Features
 * aplay & arecord usage working today
 * alsamixer & amixer usage working today
 * topology binaries are parsed by sof-pipe and modules are loaded as
   SO shared libraries. 
 * pipelines run as individual userspace threads 
 * pipelines can be pinned to efficency cores
 * pipelines can use realtime priority.
 * alsa sink and alsa source modules available.
 * pipelines can block (non blocking and mmap todo)

#License
Code is a mixture of LGPL and BSD 3c.

#Usage
Please build as cmake project, for IPC3 (functional)

```
cd sof
mkdir build_plugin
cd build_plugin
cmake ../tools/plugin
```
and for IPC4 (non functional)

```
cmake ../tools/plugin -DPLUGIN_IPC4=ON
```
then (use default ALSA prefix atm)

```
sudo make install <ALSA prefix>
sudo ../tools/plugin/hack-install.sh
```

Some hackery is needed currently to install and create soft links
for the processing modules.

Code can then be run by starting sof-pipe with your desired topology

```
 ./sof-pipe -T /lib/firmware/intel/sof-tplg/sof-bdw-nocodec.tplg
```

At this point the sof-pipe daemon is waiting for IPC. Audio applications can now invoke sof-pipe processing via

```
aplay -Dsof:bdw-nocodec:1:1:default:default:48k2c16b -f dat some48kHz.wav
```
This renders audio to the sof-pipe daemon using the bdw-nocodec topology
on pipeline 1. The above example needs to be 48k as example pipe has no SRC/ASRC.

Likewise

```
arecord -Dsof:bdw-nocodec:2:1:default:default:48k2c16b -f dat file.wav
```
Will record audio using teh bdw-nocodec topology and pipeline 2.

Mixer settings can be adjusted for bdw-nocodec by

```
alsamixer -Dsof:bdw-nocodec:1
```

#Work in Progress
The code is full of ```TODO``` statements that need to be resolved. This
also include the ```hack-install.sh``` install script for module
installation. YMMV.

#TODO Items (and T-shirt size) for single pipeline E2E audio
 * IPC4 support in tplg parser (M)
 * IPC4 support in plugin (pipe/ipc4.c) (M)
 * Fix ALSA -Dhw: device support (S), currently only default ALSA device works
 * Deprecate POSIX message queues for IPC and use UNIX sockets.(S)
 * Make better build system for modules i.e. remove hack-install.sh (S)
 * Need a simpler aplay/arecord cmd line.
