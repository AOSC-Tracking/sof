  # Build and run fuzzer for 5s just to check that it runs properly. If it
  # consistently fails in under 5s you probably did something wrong

  # If you came here to quickly copy/paste the invocation of some build
  # script in order to reproduce a failure reported by github then you
  # will be disappointed by the Github Action below: it's magical. For a
  # thorough reproduction you must follow the links above. For a quick,
  # dirty and incomplete reproduction hack you can try the following two
  # lines. Don't do this at home.
