# If you want to fork or mirror sof.git _without_ doing the same for
# rimage.git then your automation may want you to change and git commit
# an absolute URL in your branch. No need to git commit for interactive
# use; a local and temporary edit of this file is enough for interactive
# use because .gitmodules is used only once to --init[ialize]
# .git/config the first time. Then .gitmodules is never used again after
